	<p> First of all I am a computer lover, and I have been studying these machines during at least 8 years. And one thing that I have learned is that it is impossible to know everything on this field, each one of us is good at a specific area of this whole universe called IT; The areas that I am more familiar with are software development, web development, and game development. I love to face new challenges everyday, and I like to solve them in the best way possible. That is the main reason why I chose Computer Science as my Major, I can develop tools which will help people solve their problems and It is a field full of challenges.</p>
